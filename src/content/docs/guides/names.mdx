## Files and folders

<YouTube id="pjnSE99-cz0" />

When it comes to naming files and folders in your projects, it's important to follow consistent conventions to ensure clarity and maintainability. Here are some guidelines to consider.

- **Avoid spaces**: Use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) instead of spaces to separate words in file and directory names.
- **Avoid special characters**: Refrain from using special characters such as `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `(`, and `)` as they can cause issues in different operating systems and tools.
- **Use `lowercase` letters**: Stick to lowercase letters to avoid confusion, especially on case-sensitive file systems.
