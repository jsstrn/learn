My teaching philosophy is centered around hands-on learning, practical application, and fostering a growth mindset. I believe that students learn best when they are actively engaged in the material, able to apply concepts in real-world scenarios, and encouraged to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. 

## Learn by doing

There are two students who want to learn to cook. One student reads cookbooks and watches cooking shows, while the other student spends time in the kitchen experimenting with recipes and techniques. Which student do you think is likely to become a better cook?

The student who spends time in the kitchen experimenting with recipes and techniques is likely to become a better cook. While reading cookbooks and watching cooking shows can provide valuable knowledge, it is the hands-on experience that truly solidifies learning. By actively engaging in the cooking process, the student learns to adapt recipes, understand flavors, and develop their own style. This experiential learning allows for deeper understanding and retention of skills compared to passive observation.

## Learn by teaching others

As the saying goes, the best way to learn something is to teach it. 

Imagine you have been tasked to teach these concepts at a workshop at your workplace or college.

Notice how you no longer see yourself as a passive learner, but an active teacher. You will naturally start to think about how to explain concepts clearly, anticipate questions, and find relatable examples. This shift in perspective deepens your understanding and retention of the material. This allows you to move from passive learning to active learning.
