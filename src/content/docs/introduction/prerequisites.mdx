## Recommendations

<Aside type="note" title="Keep in mind" icon="starlight">
Aim to get to a level where you can comfortably read and understand code snippets, run code in a code editor, and perform basic terminal commands. You don't need to be an expert, but having a foundational understanding will significantly enhance your learning experience.

### Learn basic programming concepts

Before diving into cloud computing, it's essential to have a solid understanding of basic programming concepts. This includes variables, data types, control structures (like loops and conditionals), functions, and object-oriented programming principles. Familiarity with these concepts will help you grasp more advanced topics in the course.

### Learn to use a code editor

A code editor is an essential tool for software and cloud infrastructure development. We recommend using [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) due to its versatility, extensive features, and wide range of extensions that enhance productivity.

### Learn basic Linux terminal commands

Familiarity with Linux terminal commands is crucial for navigating and managing cloud environments, as many cloud services run on Linux-based systems. Learning basic commands will help you perform tasks such as file manipulation, system monitoring, and software installation.
