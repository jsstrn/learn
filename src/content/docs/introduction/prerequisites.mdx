## Machine and network requirements

<Aside type="danger" title="Do not use your work machine">
  We do not recommend using your work machine as you may run into issues
  installing software and network restrictions due to company policies.
</Aside>

Please ensure that your machine and network meet the following requirements:

1. Choose a personal computer with a recently updated operating system. For Windows users, please see the requirements for [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](#windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl).
1. At least **8 GB of RAM** is recommended for running development tools and cloud services smoothly.
1. A minimum of **20 GB of free disk space** to accommodate software installations and project files.
1. A **stable internet connection** to access online video calls and cloud services. You may encounter restrictions if you are on a corporate or school network.

## Basic programming concepts

While we typically do not write code when developing cloud infrastructure, we have found that knowing basic programming concepts is beneficial to our students. Concepts like variables, functions, and control structures are often used in infrastructure-as-code tools and cloud service configurations.

## Know how to use a code editor

Knowing your way around a code editor will help you navigate files, update configurations, and run scripts efficiently. We will use [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but feel free to use any code editor you prefer.

## Linux terminal commands

You should know how to navigate around the file system, run scripts, and install software directly from the terminal. Common commands you should be familiar with include `cd`, `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and `mkdir`. You should ideally know how to use a text editor like `nano` or `vim`.

For Linux and macOS users, you can practice using the built-in terminal application on your machine or install a terminal emulators of your choosing. For Windows users, please refer to the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](#windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl) section below.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

<Aside type="danger" title="A note to Windows users" icon="seti:windows">
  Some Windows users may struggle with the course because you are working on a Windows machine but developing on a Linux-based environment. These are two distinctly different operating systems with different file systems, command-line interfaces, and software compatibility. As such, navigating the file system, saving and opening files, and using terminal commands can be confusing so we recommend you familiarize yourself with WSL and VS Code prior to the course.
</Aside>

For Windows users, you should be familiar with using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run a Linux environment directly on your Windows machine and how to set it up to work with VS Code.
