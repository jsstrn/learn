## Machine and network requirements

<Aside type="danger" title="Do not use your work machine">
  We do not recommend using your work machine as you may run into issues
  installing software and network restrictions due to company policies.
</Aside>

Please ensure that your machine and network meet the following requirements:

1. Choose a personal computer with a recently updated operating system. For Windows users, please see the requirements for [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](#windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl).
1. At least **8 GB of RAM** is recommended for running development tools and cloud services smoothly.
1. A minimum of **20 GB of free disk space** to accommodate software installations and project files.
1. A **stable internet connection** to access online video calls and cloud services. You may encounter restrictions if you are on a corporate or school network.

## Basic programming concepts

Before diving into cloud computing, it's essential to have a solid understanding of basic programming concepts. This includes variables, data types, control structures (like loops and conditionals), functions, and object-oriented programming principles. Familiarity with these concepts will help you grasp more advanced topics in the course.

## Know how to use a code editor

A code editor is an essential tool for software development and cloud infrastructure deployment. We will use [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but feel free to use any code editor you are comfortable with.

## Linux terminal commands

Familiarity with Linux terminal commands is crucial for navigating and managing cloud environments, as many cloud services run on Linux-based systems. Learning basic commands will help you perform tasks such as file manipulation, system monitoring, and software installation.

For Linux and macOS users, you can practice using the built-in terminal application on your machine. Feel free to explore the many terminal emulators available for both Linux and macOS. For Windows users, please refer to the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](#windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl) section below.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

<Aside type="danger" title="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
  Some Windows users may struggle with the course because you are working on a
  Windows machine but developing on a Linux-based environment. Navigating the
  file system, saving and opening files, and using terminal commands can be
  confusing. Familiarizing yourself with WSL and VS Code will help you avoid
  these challenges.
</Aside>

For Windows users, you should be familiar with using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run a Linux environment directly on your Windows machine and how to set it up to work with VS Code.
