## Docker CLI version

Check the version of Docker installed on your system.

```sh
docker --version
```

## List all images

List all Docker images.

```sh
docker images
```

## List containers

List all running containers including their container id, image, command, creation time, status, ports, and names. This command will only show containers that are currently running.

```sh
docker ps
```

List all running and stopped containers.

```sh
docker ps --all
```

## Pull an image from a registry

Pull a Docker image from the Docker Hub registry.

```sh
docker pull <image-name>
```

### Example

This command pulls the latest Nginx image from Docker Hub.

```sh
docker pull nginx
```

## Run a Docker container

Run a Docker container.

```sh
docker run <image-name>
```

Run a Docker container in detached mode. You can also use the shorthand `-d`.

```sh
docker run --detach <image-name>
```

Publish a host port to a container port. You can also use the shorthand `-p`.

```sh
docker run --publish <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name>
```

### Example

This command runs an Nginx container in detached mode and maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container.

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

## Stop a running Docker container

You need the container id to stop a running container. Run `docker ps` to find the container id.

```sh
docker stop <container-id>
```

## Remove a Docker container

You need to stop a container before you can remove it.

```sh
docker rm <container-id>
```

## Remove a Docker image

You can only remove an image if no containers are using it. Therefore, you may need to stop and remove any containers based on the image before you can delete the image itself.

```sh
docker rmi <image-name>
```

## Inspect a Docker image

```sh
docker inspect <image-name>
```

## Inspect a Docker container

```sh
docker inspect <container-id>
```
